How to use this:
Step 1: Create "uagent.txt" and "Queue.txt" files
Step 2: Add your useragent to uagent.txt (you can find this my looking up "what is my user agent" on your browser)
Step 3: add whatever crunchyroll vids you wanna download to Queue.txt
Step 4: run the exe file and follow the prompts

Please note: Crunchyroll has a cookie time limit so you might have to view 1 crunchyroll vid to refresh cookies.
Other note: After the program goes through the entire queue, the program will wipe the contents of the queue.txt file
